### Exam Preparation Kit Using Natural Language Processing
#### Introduction
The Exam Preparation Kit is a cutting-edge platform designed to revolutionize the way students prepare for their exams. Utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this system features an Artificial Assistant that supports students through personalized study experiences. By identifying individual areas of weakness and tailoring study materials accordingly, the platform aims to enhance scholastic achievement across various subjects.

#### Key Features
1) Customized Study Material: Teachers can upload study material, enabling students to practice and learn from curated content.
2) Intelligent Assessment: The system evaluates student responses using the Sentence-BERT model, comparing their answers against teacher-provided sample answers to gauge understanding.
3) Adaptive Learning: By assessing weak areas and focusing on them through repetitive, similar question clusters, the system personalizes the learning experience to improve student performance.

#### System Components
1) Grading Answers: Utilizes Sentence-BERT for semantic similarity measurements between student responses and correct answers, ensuring accurate and fair grading.
2) Weak Area Assessment and Question Clustering: Employs an algorithm that assigns weight to questions based on performance and feedback, identifying weak areas for targeted practice.

I have published a research paper that details the methodologies, technologies, and effectiveness of this Exam Preparation Kit. For a deeper understanding of the system's scientific foundation, read our paper here. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9579511
